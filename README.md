# AlgoVisualizer
This project was made with just vanilla javascript.<br>
I showed how bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort work. As<br>
well as Djiksrta's Algorithm and A* Algorithm for pathfinding.<br>
The css works on chrome perfectly, but needs work to use with firefox, or any other<br>
browser, although there is css for mozilla in the css file, but it has not yet been <br>
perfected.<br>
